# datum

An interesting language.
It can be summed up as a dynamically-typed pure-functional programming language, but with weird terminology.

# Concepts

datum is built around two concepts:

    - datums
    - reductions

## A datum
A value, which is a value from an algebraic data type.
In Haskell, this would be a value.

## A reduction
A pattern that extracts parts of a datum and changes it into a different datum.
In Haskell, this would be a function.
